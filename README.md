# STAT386-Project2
This is my code to use an API to pull data from NASA's website. I pulled data about asteroids that approached earth in the last year. I was unfortunately not able to get the data compiled into a nice and neat pandas data frame, but the code shows what I was trying to do as I worked on it.
